# Applying Machine Learning to signal feature extraction

At present, an effort is underway to apply Machine Learning Techniques
to extracting the signal features. While fitting is a crucial part of
this process, in its final stages it may differ from a regular fit in
that signal parameters can be extracted from the waveform directly.
