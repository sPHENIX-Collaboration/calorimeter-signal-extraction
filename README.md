# Signal Feature Extraction tools for sPHENIX calorimeters

This repoistory is intended for managing software that's not production
grade but rather is used for data exploration and experimentation.

# Folder naming convention

Since data is used in input for some applications committed in this repo,
we want to ensure that none of the input files are accidentally committed
to GitHub (for size and organization reasons). Any folder named ```data``` will
be ignored by *git*. Same goes for files with extentions
* ```root```
* ```npy```
